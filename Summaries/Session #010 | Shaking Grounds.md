# Shaking Grounds

## King of the Jungle
The party wakes the sound of stomping and roaring, as two Tyrannosaurus Rex come charging after them. Aramil sets a rope trap, hoping to buy them time, before running as fast as they can to the east, toward the cliffs that make the Mbala mesa. The Tyrannosaurus Rex trips, ripping trees from their roots, but gets back up and presses on with another one behind him. After letting off lightning blast that gets both, Grimwald continues to follow the party in running away from the beasts as they close in on them - it didn't seem to do much to them. Aramil, noticing a possible cave in the face of the mesa, directs his party to it. They barely manage to make it inside to safety, where the Tyrannosaurus Rex cannot reach them. The beasts don't seem to be interested in leaving, as they wait for the party to leave the cave. 

## A Lair of Drakes
Instead, the party finds a tunnel that leads upward. They follow the tunnel into a large cavern, which seems to have a sleeping drake. After disturbing its sleep, it starts charging at them - along with four other drakes, each a different color. Combat ensues, and the party emerges victorious, though it proved to be the most difficult encounter yet. The cavern itself seems to be enchanted with several types of magic - a false cave entrance and a magical fire spewing trap. Past the trap was a door with no handle - only a keyhole - as well as a chest containing a magical stone, some potions and coin. They take a long rest within the cave to continue their adventures the next day.
